# Descriptions

## A few paragraphs

**Materia** is a **comprehensive rework of Minecraft progression** that pushes the game toward real-world-inspired technology and production chains. Instead of jumping quickly to a vanilla crafting table and furnace-driven metalwork, you start with stone-age scavenging and fabrication (rocks, knapping, hewing, lashings), then build up stations that unlock increasingly capable crafting and processing.

A core theme is that **crafting is station- and tool-driven**: early recipes run through a **primitive crafting table**, and later manufacturing relies on **kilns** (with upgrades like chimneys/bellows and higher-temperature variants), **anvils** (stone → bronze → iron tiers with more tool slots/inputs), and handling constraints like **hot metals that must be manipulated with tongs**. This creates a more granular loop where materials must be processed, heated, shaped, and assembled through multiple steps rather than condensed into a single vanilla recipe.

Alongside the main tech ladder, the mod adds a lot of “civilization” systems that interlock with progression: **ceramics and liquids** (crucibles, water pots, amphorae and fermentation), **textiles and storage** (sewn sacks/baskets, wool-to-string workflows), **expanded dye chemistry/colors**, and a broad set of mechanical content (from early survival tools to things like **logic blocks**, **power components**, and even **cannons/explosives**). The documentation in `documentation/` is organized by content type (blocks/items/recipes/mechanics) with heavy cross-linking, and describes the intended “eras” (stone/bronze/iron/steel) and the stations/mechanics that gate each.

## A single paragraph

Materia is a progression overhaul mod that replaces “one-step” vanilla advancement with a realistic, station-based tech tree: you begin with stone-age gathering, knapping, and woodworking (hewing), unlock a primitive crafting workstation, then move into ceramics, heat management, kilns, and tiered anvils where **hot-metal handling and tool-tagged forging recipes** matter; on top of that foundation it layers interconnected systems like liquids/fermentation (amphorae), boiling/processing (water pot), textiles and storage (sewn sacks), expanded dyes, and later-game mechanical/electrical and combat-adjacent content (logic blocks, power components, cannons), all documented in a cross-referenced wiki-style `documentation/` folder and backed by substantial custom items, blocks, tags, and recipes under the `materia` namespace.

## A single sentence

**Materia** is a Minecraft progression overhaul that builds a realistic stone→metalworking tech tree around tool- and station-gated crafting (knapping/hewing, kilns, hot-metal forging on tiered anvils), plus interconnected systems like liquids/fermentation, textiles/storage, expanded dyes, and advanced mechanics like logic and power components.

Materia overhauls Minecraft progression with station- and tool-gated crafting: knap stone, hew wood, fire kilns, forge on tiered anvils, manage heat and liquids, and build into textiles, dyes, logic, power components, and cannons.
