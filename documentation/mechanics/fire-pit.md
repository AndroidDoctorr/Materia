## Fire pit

The fire pit is an early cooking/processing station.

It has its own GUI and runs **fire pit recipes** while burning fuel.

## GUI

Slot layout:

- **Input**: 1 item at a time
- **Fuel**: burns fuel items (no coal coke)
- **Outputs**: recipes can produce multiple outputs (up to 5)

## Fuel

The fire pit accepts many early fuels (wood fuels, coal/charcoal, etc.), but **does not accept coal coke**.

## Inputs and outputs

- **Input slot**: 1 item at a time
- **Output slots**: up to 5 outputs per craft

Recipes can produce multiple outputs (for example, 1 input item could yield multiple items).

## Neolithic role: early processing + charcoal

The fire pit is usually your first “processing station” after the primitive crafting table.

Common early uses include:

- **Charcoal production** from logs (fuel + early metalworking dependency)
- Early byproducts like **ash** (used in recipes such as grout)
