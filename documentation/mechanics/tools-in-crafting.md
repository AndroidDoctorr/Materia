## Tools in crafting

Many Materia recipes treat tools as “crafting tools”.

## What that means

When used in certain crafting recipes:

- the tool is not consumed
- the tool takes durability damage (often 1) per craft
- the tool breaks when it reaches max damage

Some tools act as containers instead (they survive unchanged).

## Examples

- Hand axe: survives crafting, takes durability damage
- Bronze saw: survives crafting, takes durability damage
- Mortar and pestle: survives crafting unchanged
