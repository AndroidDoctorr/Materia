## Water pot

The water pot is a utility block for boiling and water handling.

## Boiling

The water pot boils when placed above a lit campfire.

## Water level

Water level ranges from **0 (empty)** to **3 (full)**.

You can move water in/out using:

- water cups / crucibles
- glass bottles (water bottles)
- buckets
- cauldrons (sneak-right-click to transfer)

## Boiling recipes

The water pot has simple in-place recipes using its 1-slot inventory:

- Bone → Glue (requires boiling)
- Tanned leather → Hardened leather (requires boiling)
- Murex glands → boiled versions (require boiling)
- Earth blocks (2) → clay balls + dirt (does not require boiling)
  - Accepts `#materia:earth_blocks` (Earth in 1.18.2; packed mud in newer versions)
- Paper mixture → paper pulp (does not require boiling)

Some recipes may change the block (e.g. earth separation replaces the water pot with an empty pot).

## Quenching (tongs)

If you right-click a water pot with **tongs containing hot metal**, the water pot can be used to quench (cool) the items.
