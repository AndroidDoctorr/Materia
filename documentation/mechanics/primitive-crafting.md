## Primitive crafting

Primitive crafting is an early-game system that lets you assemble key starter gear before you have full workstations.

JEI includes a dedicated **Primitive crafting** category.

## Primitive crafting table

The primitive crafting table allows some crafting, but is limited to recipes that can fit withing a 3x2 grid.

The primitive crafting table itself is crafted as a special crafting recipe requiring:

- 1× Rock
- 1× Stone hammer (**must be at least 50% durability**)
- 1× Flint knife (**must be at least 50% durability**)
- 1× Crucible

Note: this recipe consumes the ingredients in the grid.

Practical early-game note:

- The crucible can be made from a [Clay bowl](../content/items/clay-bowl.md), and the bowl can be fired on a **vanilla campfire** (no kiln required).
