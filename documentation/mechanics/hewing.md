## Hewing

Hewing is an early woodworking recipe used to turn logs into **rough planks**.

JEI includes a dedicated **Hewing** category.

## Recipe rule

- 1× any log (`#minecraft:logs`)
- 1× basic axe (hand axe / wooden axe / stone axe)

Result:

- 4× rough planks matching the log type

The axe is not consumed, but it takes 1 durability damage (and breaks if it hits max damage).

## Important: saws are excluded

Saws are explicitly excluded from hewing. Saws are reserved for other log-processing recipes (e.g. posts).
