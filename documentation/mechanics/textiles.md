## Textiles (overview)

This page explains the “why” of the textile system: **storage**, **bindings**, and **dyes**.

## Core ideas

- **Strings + needles** enable “sewn” crafts (like sacks).
- **Wickers** enable “woven” crafts (like baskets).
- **Dyes** expand your available colors and often unlock dyed textile variants.

## The early textile loop (practical)

### 1) Get a sewing setup (for sacks)

- Get **string** (anything that counts as `#materia:strings`, see [tag reference](../reference/tags/textiles-and-storage.md#materiastrings))
- Get a **needle** (anything that counts as `#materia:all_needles`, see [tag reference](../reference/tags/textiles-and-storage.md#materiaall_needles))
- Combine **carpet + needle + string** to craft a sack (carpet color → sack color)

See:

- [Sacks](../content/items/sacks.md)
- [Textiles and storage materials (tags)](../reference/tags/textiles-and-storage.md)

#### Where does early string come from?

In the stable 1.18.2 gameplay loop, sheep give **wool clumps**, and you spin clumps into string using a **spindle**:

- [Spindle](../content/items/spindle.md)

### 2) Weaving setup (for baskets)

Craft baskets using “wicker” materials (anything that counts as `#materia:wickers`, see [tag reference](../reference/tags/textiles-and-storage.md#materiawickers)).

See:

- [Basket](../content/blocks/basket.md)
- [Textiles and storage materials (tags)](../reference/tags/textiles-and-storage.md)

## Dyes and textile variants

Dyes show up in textiles in two big ways:

- **Dyed strings** (used anywhere `#materia:strings` is accepted; see [tag reference](../reference/tags/textiles-and-storage.md#materiastrings))
- **Dyed carpets** (used to craft dyed sacks)

See:

- [Dyes](../chemistry/dyes.md)
- [Sacks](../content/items/sacks.md)
