The milk cup is a filled ceramic cup. It’s roughly equivalent to a **bottle-sized milk container**:

- **1 milk cup/bottle = 1 unit**
- **3 units = 1 bucket/pot**

See: [Liquids and containers (reference)](../../reference/tags/liquids-and-containers.md)

## Obtaining

Fill a [Crucible](crucible.md) from a **milk pot** (takes 1 level).
