## Precision tools

This page groups “specialty” tools used for crafting chains and advanced processing.

## Chisels

- Iron chisel (pairs with an iron/steel hammer offhand for special mining behavior)

## Files, drawplates, bores

The mod includes dedicated items for working metal parts:

- files
- drawplates
- bores

These are commonly made on the **iron anvil** (see [Anvils](../../../mechanics/anvils.md)).

## Mortar and pestle

Used for grinding/crushing in recipes.
It survives crafting unchanged (acts like a container item).
