## Hammers

Hammers are used for early processing, crafting, and later metalworking.

## Early hammers

- [Hammer stone](../hammer-stone.md)
- [Stone hammer](../stone-hammer.md)

## Metal hammers

There are higher-tier hammers (bronze/iron/steel/diamond/netherite).
Their recipes are in `shared/src/main/resources/data/materia/recipes/`.

## Crafting behavior

Many tools in this mod are treated as “crafting tools”:

- they survive crafting recipes
- they lose durability (usually 1) per craft
