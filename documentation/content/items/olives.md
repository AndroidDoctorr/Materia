Olives are harvested from olive trees and are primarily used to make **olive oil**.

## Getting olives

Olives come from olive tree leaves in two ways:

- **Harvesting**: when olive leaves have olives, right-click to pick them.
- **Breaking leaves**: olive leaves can also drop olives (loot table chance), similar to vanilla leaf drops.
