Tanned leather is a processed form of leather used by many crafting recipes (armor components, saddle/horse armor, etc.).

## How you get it

Tanned leather is produced by **tanning** on a drying rack:

- Put `minecraft:leather` on a drying rack
- Ensure a **lit campfire** is adjacent
- Wait **30 seconds** (600 ticks)
- Remove the finished leather to receive `materia:tanned_leather`
