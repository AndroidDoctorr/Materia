A basic early-game item used for crafting and throwing.

## Getting rocks

Most players get their first rocks by finding **rock blocks** in the world and breaking them:

- Block: `materia:rock` (small surface/cave rocks generated during worldgen)
- Loot table: `shared/src/main/resources/data/materia/loot_tables/blocks/rock.json`

Alternative (if you already have cobblestone):

- `minecraft:cobblestone` → 4× `materia:rock`
  - `shared/src/main/resources/data/materia/recipes/rocks_from_cobblestone.json`

## Uses

- Used to craft the primitive crafting table (see [Primitive crafting](../../mechanics/primitive-crafting.md))
- Used to craft the hammer stone (see [Hammer stone](hammer-stone.md))

## Throwing

Rocks can be thrown as a projectile.
