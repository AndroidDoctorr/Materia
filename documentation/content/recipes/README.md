## Recipes

This section documents crafting/processing recipes. The goal is:

- **Explain the intent** (what the recipe unlocks / why it exists)
- **Show the inputs visually** (optional icon grid)
- **Link to the JSON source of truth**

## Conventions

- Prefer one page per “notable” recipe chain (or per workstation), rather than every trivial recipe.
- Always link the underlying JSON file(s).
- When a recipe accepts multiple possible items, prefer naming a **tag** (ex: `#materia:all_saws`) rather than listing every item.
  - Link the tag to: `documentation/reference/tags/`

## Examples

- [Wood tongs recipe (example page)](wood-tongs.md)
- [Example: 3×3 crafting grid](example-crafting-grid.md)
- [Example: 2×2 crafting grid](example-2x2.md)
- [Example: smelting layout](example-smelting.md)
