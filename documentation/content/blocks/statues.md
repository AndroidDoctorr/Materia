## Statues

This page covers Materia decorative statue blocks.

## Marble statue (body + bust)

Marble statues are a two-block composition:

- `materia:marble_body`
- `materia:marble_bust`

Crafting:

- Both are made from `materia:marble` via **stonecutting**:
  - `shared/src/main/resources/data/materia/recipes/marble_body_from_marble_stonecutting.json`
  - `shared/src/main/resources/data/materia/recipes/marble_bust_from_marble_stonecutting.json`

Placement / facing:

- The body faces away from the player when placed.
- If you place a bust **on top of** a marble body, the bust automatically matches the body’s facing (so the statue stays aligned).

## Aquila Aurea (metal statue)

The Aquila Aurea is a decorative block, but it’s in the **metalworking** progression rather than stoneworking.
