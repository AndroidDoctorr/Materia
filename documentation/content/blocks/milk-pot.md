The milk pot is a ceramic container block that stores milk in **0–3 levels**.

It follows the same sizing rule as other containers:

- **1 level** = 1 cup/bottle worth
- **3 levels** = 1 bucket/pot worth

See: [Liquids and containers (reference)](../../reference/tags/liquids-and-containers.md)

## Obtaining

No crafting recipe is documented yet for the milk pot.

If you intended it to be craftable like the water pot, this is a likely gap to implement and then document.

## Using the milk pot (vanilla interoperability)

The milk pot supports:

- **Crucible → milk cup** (takes 1 level)
- **Glass bottle → milk bottle** (takes 1 level)
- **Milk bottle → glass bottle** (adds 1 level)
- **Milk bucket → bucket** (fills to 3)
- **Bucket → milk bucket** (takes 3, only when full)
