## Primitive crafting table

The primitive crafting table is an early-game workstation.

## Opening

- Right-click to open the primitive crafting GUI

## Getting one

Crafted via a special recipe (see [Primitive crafting](../../mechanics/primitive-crafting.md)).

New-player note:

- The special recipe consumes its ingredients and requires a **crucible**, which you can make by firing a [Clay bowl](../items/clay-bowl.md) on a vanilla campfire.
