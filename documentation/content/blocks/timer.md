## Timer

The timer emits a repeating **1-tick pulse** on its output.

## IO mapping

Top-down view:

```text
      output (front)
            |
        [ TIMER ]
```

- **Output**: front
- **Inputs**: none (it runs on its own)

## Setting the interval

Right-clicking the timer cycles an internal `interval` property:

- 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0 → …

In 1.18.2, the countdown tick targets are:

- interval 0: 20 ticks (~1.0s)
- interval 1: 10 ticks (~0.5s)
- interval 2: 5 ticks (~0.25s)
- interval 3: 3 ticks (~0.15s)

The output pulse is generated by toggling output on for 1 tick and then off on the following tick.

## Output behavior

- Output is binary (0 or 15).
- Output is strong + weak power on the front side for chaining.

## Screenshot / GIF ideas

- Timer → lamp (shows pulse), with a close-up showing interval cycling.
