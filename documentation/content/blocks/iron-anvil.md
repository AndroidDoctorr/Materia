## Iron anvil

The iron anvil is the **highest anvil tier**. It adds a third tool slot and a second input slot, enabling the most complex shaping recipes.

## Obtaining

Craft it on a bronze anvil:

- [Bronze anvil: 3× wrought iron blocks → iron anvil](../../../shared/src/main/resources/data/materia/recipes/bronze_anvil/iron_anvil_from_blocks.json)

## How it works

- **Slots**: 3 tool slots + 2 hot input slots
- **Required inputs**:
  - at least one input must be present and **hot**
  - some recipes use a second (optional) input; inputs can be in either slot
- **Tools**:
  - recipes can require up to 3 tool tags
  - tools can be in any order across the tool slots

## Durability (iron anvils are very durable, but not infinite)

- **Max durability**: 800
- **Damage rules (roughly)**: most recipes are minimal wear; “big” crafts (blocks/anvils) wear it more

## Cooling

Items left in the anvil will cool over time (every ~2 seconds).
