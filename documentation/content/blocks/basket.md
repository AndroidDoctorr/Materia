## Basket

The basket is a small **early storage block**.

## Storage

- **Automation**: supports item insertion/extraction from all sides
- **Pickup**: when broken by a player, it drops itself and **keeps its contents** (stored in the item’s NBT)

## Obtaining

## Notes

- The basket is **flammable**.
- If a basket containing explosives gets destroyed by an explosion/fire, it may detonate (and can also launch fireworks).
