## FAQ / Troubleshooting

## The mod doesn’t load / game crashes

- **Confirm Minecraft + loader version** matches the jar.
- **Check dependencies** are installed (and correct version).
- **Attach logs**:
  - `logs/latest.log`
  - crash report (if present)

## Where are configs?

Depends on loader/version. Document your config files here once they stabilize.

## I can’t craft X

- Check the recipe page (see [Recipes](../content/recipes/README.md)).
- Some recipes may be gated behind a mechanic/progression step (see [Mechanics](../mechanics/README.md)).
